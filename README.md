# Web Programming Journey

Hello, and welcome to my web programming path! This repository is dedicated to documenting my progress and containing the projects I work on during this journey.

## Learning Path

I've kicked off my learning with the [Kodluyoruz.org Web Development Path](https://academy.patika.dev/tr/paths/baslangic-seviye-frontend-web-development-patikasi) to grasp the fundamentals.
I've structured my learning path focusing on building a strong foundation in the following areas:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Web Browsers and Developer Tools
- Basic HTTP and Server Communication

## Projects

Throughout this path, I'll be working on various projects to apply and reinforce what I've learned. You can find all my projects in their respective folders, each with detailed instructions and requirements.
Feel free to explore each project, and witness my growth and improvements over time.

## Contribution

If you have any suggestions, improvements, or if you'd like to contribute to my learning journey, please don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request.
